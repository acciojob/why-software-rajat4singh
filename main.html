	<h1><center>Why I want to become a developer?</center></h1>
	<p>I started my career as a site engineer 👷‍♂️ and swiftly transitioned into the realm of 🧑‍💻software development, utilizing my passion for 🌐web technologies to create remarkable products for users 👥.<br><br>

My passion for web technologies became evident during my college days 🏫. I have created a web view Android app 📱 of Pune University by watching 🎦YouTube videos, thinking that it would help students🧑‍🎓 to get quick access to website links. It became popular within 2-3 months 📢 on the Play Store, with almost 10 thousand downloads 📈.<br><br> After realizing that ⚖️ it's not legal to publish other's websites without permission, I removed it from the Play Store.😮‍💨

📌From this point forward, it laid the foundation of my interest in web technologies😎. <br><br>Gradually, I self-learned technologies, digital marketing, and brand building.

🎯I have always aspired to solve people's issues in the online world by creating products that cater to their needs.

In 2020, I created FameSeller.com, 📑 a groundbreaking platform that revolutionized the 🛒 buying and selling of social media accounts safely.🤝
I have created numerous 🌐 Websites and 📱 Android applications that are currently dominating the top pages of Google's search results.📈 (Check out My Resume for more information.)<br><br>

✅ I have technical expertise in On-page and Off-page SEO, WordPress, Content Writing, App Store optimization, Logo design, and Video editing.

<br><br>Currently, I'm learning 🧑‍💻 Full stack web development at AccioJob.
